# IO Module

The IO Module contains useful methods for parsing and writing N-Triples files.

## TODO

* Implement full N-Triples specification as in https://www.w3.org/TR/n-triples/

* There is also a library called [rdf2go](https://github.com/deiu/rdf2go) that is able to parse Turtle format files, which is a superset of N-Triple files. Maybe use that in the future, but make sure it is faster and safer.
